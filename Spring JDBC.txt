-------------------------------------------
Problems of JDBC:-

   again
   Spring JDBC will solve this problem
2. In normal JDBC handling exception are really painful things
   But spring JDBC will solve this problems
3. Database logic is time consuming process   
4. Repeating business logic code again and again in all classes

Advantages of spring JDBC:-

NOTE:-
1. JDBC template is a interface its implementation class is DriverManagerDataSource and jdbc template want   
   object of its implementation class which is DriverManagerDataSource .

2. DriverManagerDataSource have some properties which we have to provide like 

driverClassName
driverURL
